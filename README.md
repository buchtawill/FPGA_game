# FPGA_game

I got interested in FPGAs and came across Digilent's Basys3 evaluation board. To start learning. I decided to make a VGA controller; that entailed generating the timing signals in hardware. After some development, I made a working timing module. The next logical step was to create an animation of the popular game Among Us, of course.
